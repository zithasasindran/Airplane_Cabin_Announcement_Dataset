if you wish to sleep remember to fasten your seatbelts over your blanket
it is a pleasure to have you on board with us today
please direct your attention to the cabin crew members as they will now demonstrate the safety information
the weather so far in rome is reported as partially cloudy with a temperature of thirteen degrees
kindly take all the belongings with you while leaving the aircraft
please keep your seatbelt fasteneds whenever the seatbelt light is one
this will prevent bags from getting exchanged with others
ladies and gentlemen welcome to rome
i hope you enjoyed your flight until now
we are expected to land in chennai in another thirty minutes from now
ladies and gentlemen please remain seated
ladies and gentlemen the doors are closed now please switch off the electronic devices including mobile phones tablets or set into airplane mode so that radio waves won't be emitted thank you
please remain seated with your seatbelt fastened until the fasten seatbelt signs have been switched off
once the signs are illuminated kindly switch off all electronic devices and store your baggage in the overhead bins or under the seat in front of you
there are five exits aboard this plane
two at the front two over the wings and one out the plane's rear end
if you are seated in one of the exit rows please do not store your bags by your feet
that would be a really bad idea
please take a moment and look around and find the nearest exit
count the rows of seats between you and the exit
in the event that the need arises to find one trust me you will be glad you did
we have pretty blinking lights on the floor that will blink in the direction of the exits
white ones along the normal rows and pretty red ones at the exit rows
in the event of a loss of cabin pressure these baggy things will drop down over your head
you stick it over your nose and mouth like the flight attendant is doing now
