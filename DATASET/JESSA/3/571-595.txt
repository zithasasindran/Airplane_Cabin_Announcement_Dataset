there is rather more snow on the runway than we'd been led to believe
flight attendants or cabin crew please prepare doors

we will be flying at an altitude of forty thousand feet at a speed of nine hundred and sixty kilometers per hour
if you wish to volunteer please stand up before the fasten seat belt sign has been switched off
after that i want all passengers and cabin crew to be belted up and no one is to walk around for any reason
ladies and gentlemen the storm is very bad
once we reach a safe altitude the captain will turn off the seat belt sign but for your safety please keep your seat belt fastened while you are seated
