ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking we have a small problem all four engines have stopped
we are doing our damnedest to get them going again
i trust you are not in too much distress
ladies and gentlemen if you look to the right you will see a fantastic view of mt rainier
i am sorry folks i meant to the left
i would like to assure you there is nothing wrong with the plane i just pressed the wrong button
ladies and gentlemen we have a little technical problem that is to be solved soon
i don't know about you but as far as i am concerned i do prefer to arrive late in this world than to arrive in advance in the other one
we are in trouble we are going down
passengers will be told about any emergency or serious malfunction
and most non serious ones too
if you are informed about a landing gear issue pressurization problem engine trouble or the need for a precautionary landing do not construe this to be a life or death situation
it's virtually always something minor though you will be kept in the loop anyway
with even an outside chance of an evacuation in mind you have to be kept in the loop
good afternoon gentlemen you will have noticed that it's a bit hairy in the skies and the wind is against us
we require a steep take off out of here and it will be tricky but hold on to your seats it's friday night and i have got a wedding reception to go to
ladies and gentlemen we shall be making an unscheduled landing and steep approach to tampere airport the plane is on fire thank you
would the lead steward please come to the flight deck immediately
adopt the brace position in preparation for a crash landing
ladies and gentlemen captain here
just had a warning light there probably a glitch so we will just contact engineering
captain it looks like it wasn't a glitch after all
ladies and gentlemen we were just struck by lightning
ladies and gentlemen you may have noticed that our descent is bumpier than usual
