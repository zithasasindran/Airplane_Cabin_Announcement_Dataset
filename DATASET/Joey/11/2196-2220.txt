if you are sitting next to a small child or someone who is acting like a small child please do us all a favor and put on your mask first
if you are traveling with two or more children please take a moment now to decide which one is your favorite
help your favorite first and then work your way down
in the seat pocket in front of you is a pamphlet about the safety features of this plane
i usually use it as a fan when i am having my own personal summer
it makes a very good fan
it also has pretty pictures
please take it out and play with it now
please take a moment now to make sure your seat belts are fastened low and tight about your waist
to fasten the belt insert the metal tab into the buckle
to release it's a pulley thing not a pushy thing like your car because you are in an airplane
there is no smoking in the cabin on this flight
there is also no smoking in the lavatory
if we see smoke coming from the lavatories we will assume you are on fire and put you out
this is a free service we provide
there are two smoking sections on this flight one outside each wing exit
we do have a movie in the smoking sections tonight hold on the movie tonight is Gone with the Wind
in a moment we will be turning off the cabin lights and it's going to get really dark really fast
if you are afraid of the dark now would be a good time to reach up and press the yellow button
the yellow button turns on your reading light
please don't press the orange button unless you absolutely have to
the orange button is your seat ejection button
we are glad to have you with us on board this flight
