 ladies and gentlemen on behalf of our captain and the rest of the crew i would like to welcome you aboard southwest airlines flight three with non stop service to phoenix
our flight time will be approximately three hours and forty two minutes and we look forward to ensuring that your journey with us today is as pleasant and carefree as possible
folks we have reached our cruising altitude now so i am going to switch the seat belt sign off
feel free to move about as you wish but please stay inside the plane till we land
it is a bit cold outside and if you walk on the wings it affects the flight pattern
thank you for flying delta business express
we hope you enjoyed giving us the business as much as we enjoyed taking you for a ride
this aircraft is equipped with a video surveillance system that monitors the cabin during taxing
any passengers not remaining in their seats until the aircraft comes to a full and complete stop at the gate will be strip searched as they leave the aircraft
we have reached our cruising altitude now and i am turning off the seat belt sign
i am switching to autopilot too
so i can come back there and visit with all of you for the rest of the flight
should the cabin lose pressure oxygen masks will drop from the overhead area
please place the bag over your own mouth and nose before assisting children
as you exit the plane please make sure to gather all of your belongings
anything left behind will be distributed evenly among the flight attendants
ladies and gentlemen welcome to amarillo
please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened while the captain taxis what is left of our airplane to the gate
please take care when opening the overhead compartments because after a landing like that sure as heck everything has shifted
the weather at our destination is fifty degrees with some broken clouds but they will try to have them fixed before we arrive
thank you and remember nobody loves you or your money more than southwest airlinesladies and gentlemen
please remain in your seats until captain crash and the crew has brought the aircraft to a screeching halt up against the gate
and once the tire smoke has cleared and the warning bells are silence we will open the door and you can pick your way through the wreckage to the terminal
we would like to thank you folks 
for flying with us today
and the next time you get the insane urge to go blasting through the skies in a pressurized metal tube we hope you will think of us here at us airways
