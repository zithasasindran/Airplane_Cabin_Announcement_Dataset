welcome to the san francisco international airport
sorry about the bumpy landing
it's not the captain's fault
it's not the co-pilot's fault
it's the asphalt
please remain seated until the plane is parked at the gate
at no time in history has a passenger beaten a plane to the gate
so please don't even try
also, please be careful opening the overhead bins
ladies and gentlemen we are aware that many of you have connecting flights departing mumbai
in the event your connecting flight has departed our ground staff will work with you to confirm you on the next available flight to your destination
thank you for your patience
please use caution when deplaning the aircraft
the jetway is slippery due to rain
ladies and gentlemen we will be using stairs for deplaning today
please watch your step
flight attendants prepare doors for arrival and crosscheck
if needed oxygen masks will be released overhead
to start the flow of oxygen reach up and pull the mask toward you fully extending the plastic tubing
place the mask over your nose and mouth and slip the elastic band over your head
to tighten the fit pull the tab on each side of the mask
the plastic bag does not need to inflate when oxygen is flowing
be sure to secure your own mask before assisting others
a life vest is located under or between your seat
to wear it tear open the plastic package remove the life vest and slip it over your head
